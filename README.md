For P4 I built off my P3 project and decided to take the ebay calculator and turn it into a sales tracker.  Users can signup/login and save the items that they have sold, while also deleting and editing existing items.  

For this project there is a php framework that uses php calls to display stored data about the user's items, insert/modify/delete existing items and login/logout.  However javascript is also used to calculate the item sales information, uses Ajax check new user info,  load existing item info into the form when editing, and in sending the information for creating new users
